Arjun grew up in a small town where public institutions were weak but present.
As a young man, he distrusted most people and preferred to stay independent.

In his early twenties, Arjun encountered a local police officer investigating
organized crime in the area. Though hesitant at first, Arjun agreed to share
minor information that could help prevent violence.

Over time, Arjun realized that cooperation with the authorities reduced harm
to innocent people. He began passing more reliable information, despite
knowing it put him at personal risk.

Midway through the story, Arjun became a trusted informant. He coordinated
with officials during multiple investigations and played a key role in
preventing a major attack.

By the end of the novel, Arjun formally joined a government task force.
He accepted institutional responsibility and worked openly with state
authorities to dismantle criminal networks.

Arjun reflected that although authority could be flawed, structured cooperation
was sometimes necessary to protect society.
