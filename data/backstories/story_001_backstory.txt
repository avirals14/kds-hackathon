Arjun grew up skeptical of authority figures due to early experiences that
taught him institutions could be unreliable and self-serving. As a result,
he avoided formal involvement with state systems whenever possible and
preferred to act independently.

However, Arjun did not view all authority as inherently corrupt. He believed
that while institutions often failed individuals, cooperation could be
considered in rare circumstances where refusing to act would lead to
significant harm to others.

He remained conflicted throughout his life, balancing a deep mistrust of
government structures with a sense of responsibility toward innocent people.
Any decision to work with officials was cautious, limited, and motivated more
by necessity than belief in the system itself.
